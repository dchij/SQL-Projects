My goal is both to display my current mastery of SQL & improve my SQL skills. This was inspired by Danny Ma and his 8 week SQL challenge.

The 8 weeks SQL Challenge was the perfect opportunity to test my skills on diverse mini projects which encompass a wide range of SQL techniques.

All the schema and query details and output are in the respective week's folder.
