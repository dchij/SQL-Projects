This [8 week SQL challenge]("https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/") is authored by [Data With Danny]("https://www.datawithdanny.com/") as part of his virtual data apprenticeship program. 

My goal is both to display my current mastery of SQL & improve my SQL skills.

The 8 weeks SQL Challenge was the perfect opportunity to test my skills on diverse mini projects which encompass a wide range of SQL techniques.

All the schema and query details and output are in the respective week's folder.
